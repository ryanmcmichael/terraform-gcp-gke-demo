# GCP GKE Demo

This demo presents a working GKE kubernetes cluster on the google cloud platform which is defined by terraform. It also includes all the necessary networking components and some demo functions which interact with kubernetes services.

Please note: this repo is not maintained. It exists as a client demo only. Please do not message me asking about implementation instructions or issues. :)
